Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Edward-0528/weatherapp.git
Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd weatherapp
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or
yarn install

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.   

Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about deployment for more information.   

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!   

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own. You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
